# SwiftUI Series – Speedrun Challenge

Below is my attempt at the [SwiftUI Series Speedrun challenge](https://www.swiftuiseries.com/speedrun). Our task was to replicate camera.app which I did in **15.47min**. Here's a [screen recording](https://youtu.be/Ss6LALX2uGA) of its creation and a screenshot of the final product below.

With more time I'd have like'd to have added…
* A 3D effect on the mode selector
* Fixed the background color of the flip camera button
* Figured out the correct font for the zoom buttons
